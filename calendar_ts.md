# Troubleshooting tkcalendar.DateEntry in Toplevel Dialog

## Problem Description

When using `tkcalendar.DateEntry` widgets for Start Date and End Date within a `tk.Toplevel` dialog (`WorkPackageDialog`), the calendar dropdown does not function correctly on macOS.
- Initial attempts involved using the dialog modally (`grab_set()`, `wait_window()`). This often resulted in the dropdown appearing as a blank or grey box, and the application potentially freezing.
- Removing `grab_set()` allowed the `DateEntry` widget itself to be visible, but clicking the dropdown arrow either did nothing or caused the grey box issue again, without displaying the calendar selector.

This indicates a likely conflict in event handling or drawing between the `Toplevel` dialog, the main application window, and the `DateEntry`'s calendar popup (which is likely another `Toplevel` window itself).

## Suspected Causes

1.  **Event Loop Conflicts:** The `Toplevel` dialog's event loop (especially when using `wait_window` or even just being active) might interfere with the processing of events required by the `tkcalendar` popup. `grab_set()` likely exacerbates this but isn't the sole cause.
2.  **Focus Management:** Tkinter might be struggling to correctly manage input focus between the main window, the dialog, the `DateEntry` widget, and its popup calendar. The popup might fail to gain or maintain focus.
3.  **Tkinter/Tcl/Tk Backend (macOS):** There might be specific issues or limitations with the underlying Tcl/Tk version used by the Python installation on macOS related to drawing or managing layered windows.
4.  **`tkcalendar` Implementation Detail:** The specific way `tkcalendar` creates and manages its dropdown window could have an incompatibility when nested within another `Toplevel`.

## Proposed Fixing Plan

We need a robust way to ensure the `WorkPackageDialog` and the `DateEntry` calendar popup can both handle their events without conflict.

**Plan A: Callback Mechanism (Preferred)**

This approach avoids blocking the event loop with `wait_window` within the dialog's parent (`TimelineEditorWindow`) while the dialog is active.

1.  **Modify `TimelineEditorWindow._add_workpackage` and `_edit_item`:**
    *   Define a nested callback function (e.g., `_on_wp_dialog_close(result)`) within each method. This function will contain the logic currently *after* the dialog creation/wait call (i.e., the logic to update the Treeview based on the `result`).
    *   Instantiate `WorkPackageDialog`, passing this nested callback function as a new `on_close_callback` argument.
    *   *Do not* call `self.wait_window(dialog)` here. The dialog will run independently, and the callback will handle the result later.

2.  **Modify `WorkPackageDialog.__init__`:**
    *   Accept a new optional argument `on_close_callback=None`.
    *   Store this callback in an instance variable (e.g., `self.on_close_callback`).
    *   Remove the `self.wait_window(self)` call. The dialog's lifecycle is now managed by user interaction (OK/Cancel/Close).

3.  **Modify `WorkPackageDialog._ok`:**
    *   After successfully gathering the `self.result`, check if `self.on_close_callback` exists.
    *   If it exists, call `self.on_close_callback(self.result)`.
    *   Proceed with `self.withdraw()` and `self._cancel()` (which calls `self.destroy()`).

4.  **Modify `WorkPackageDialog._cancel`:**
    *   Check if `self.on_close_callback` exists.
    *   If it exists, call `self.on_close_callback(None)` to signal cancellation.
    *   Proceed with destroying the window.

5.  **Reinstate `grab_set()`:** Add `self.grab_set()` back into `WorkPackageDialog.__init__` to restore modality, as the event blocking should now be resolved by the callback approach.

**Plan B: Alternative (If Plan A Fails)**

1.  **Explicit Event Loop Updates:** Experiment with adding `self.update_idletasks()` in `WorkPackageDialog` before the calendar might be needed, although this is less reliable.
2.  **Use `tkcalendar.Calendar`:** Replace `DateEntry` with the full `Calendar` widget embedded directly in the dialog. This avoids the potentially problematic dropdown mechanism. This changes the UI significantly.

**Implementation Order:**

1.  Implement Plan A (Callback Mechanism).
2.  Test thoroughly.
3.  If Plan A fails, investigate Plan B options.
